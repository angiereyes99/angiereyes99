### Hi I'm Angelo!

I'm a current Senior at San Francisco State University studying Computer Science! 
I am also a current Software Engineer Intern for [The @ Company](https://atsign.com/home) where I am 
developing a Dart and Flutter application using the secondary server developed by the company.

I am familiar with Full-Stack development in both Web and Mobile applications!

Some of my technical experiences include:

Aside from programming, I was also a Division II Wrestler at my respected university, and was a starter
