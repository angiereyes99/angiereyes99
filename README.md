### Hi I'm Angelo!


I'm a current Senior at San Francisco State University studying Computer Science! 
I am also a current Software Engineer Intern for [The @ Company](https://atsign.com/home) where I am 
developing a Dart and Flutter application using the secondary server developed by the company.

I am familiar with Full-Stack development in both Web and Mobile applications!

Some of my technical experiences include:

• [OmniVision Technologies](https://www.ovt.com/) (SWE Intern of Summer 2019) 📸 👨‍💻
• [SFSU Computer Science Mentor] (https://cs.sfsu.edu/) (Mentor of Fall 2020) 👨‍🏫

• [Twitter Spam Detection Research] (https://cs.sfsu.edu/) (Research Assistant of Fall 2019) 🐦 👨‍💻

Aside from programming, I was also a Division II Wrestler at my respected university, and was a starter
for the 2019-2020 season, where I competed in the Super Region 6 tournament!
